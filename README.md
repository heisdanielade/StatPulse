## StatPulse

StatPulse is a statistics project analysing a real-world community health dataset using Python. The goal is to explore and visualize key demographic and health-related variables, compute descriptive statistics and interpret patterns using measures like central tendency, dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis. This project is part of a university course on Descriptive and Economic Statistics and demonstrates practical data analysis using Jupyter Notebook.

  - **Age** (Ratio scale) — Age of the participant, measured in years (integer).
  - **Quality of Life Score** (Interval scale) — A measure of the participant's quality of life, measured on a point scale between 50 and 100 (integer).

- **Categorical/Qualitative Variables**:
